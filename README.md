# üåç NGO Network Platform ‚Äì Erasmus+ Projects

## üìå Overview

This is a full-stack web platform built to support **non-governmental organizations (NGOs)** participating in European programmes, particularly **Erasmus+**. The goal is to facilitate collaboration, promote educational initiatives, and share opportunities in a centralized, accessible, and modern digital environment.

NGOs can create public profiles, publish Erasmus+ projects, and list partners‚Äîwhether they are **countries**, other **registered NGOs**, or **external organizations** identified via Instagram. When an external partner later creates an account, all projects that reference their handle will automatically link to their new profile.
